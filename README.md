# Blobfish 2
The spiritual sequel to Blobfish, written in pure (not very portable, but trying) C.
UCI-compatible (TODO).

## Building
Ease of building Blobfish2 and portability is a goal.
- There is a `CMakeLists.txt`.

## Pitfalls
- In haste, there are a lot of infinite loops in parsing.
- Issues with unsigned subtraction
